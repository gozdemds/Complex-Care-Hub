This code is originally generated in Python 2.7, but also compatible with the newer versions of Python. 

The input data is mostly read from .txt files.
Note that you if you want to run the code on your local computers you are advised to download all available documents within a single file. You may still need to check the mentioned addresses within the script.
Some of the input variables are embedded within the code itself (i.e., time frame and hub capacity).

The output is again written in a .txt file. This file will automatically be generated after you run the code successfully.
The output is written in the .txt file with a certain systematic structure, which you may follow from the script or you can simply use the excell template provided to see the output values in an editable and neat format. In order to do that, follow the steps listed below:
- open output.txt
- Press ctrl+A
- Press ctrl+C
- open the excell template
- click on the cell B3
- Press ctrl+V

!!! Keep in mind that this code is only a repesentative version of the baseline scenario and the user may need to change the input values/parameters and/or script for further analysis. We hope that in-line comments would be helpful in such situation!!!
